# RoguePlots
Create phlylogeny plots that illustrate the placement of rogue taxa

RoguePlots are tree summaries that show the placement of individual taxa on a partially unresolved phylogeny, e.g., a consensus tree or other tree summary. These plots are described in detail in the following publication, available as a preprint from bioRXiv:
Illustrating phylogenetic placement of fossils using RoguePlots: An example from ichneumonid parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae) and an extensive morphological matrix
